# Pi/E Comparisons

This program's purpose is to have students implement Euler's method for approximating e, multiple methods for approximating pi, and newtons method for appxroximating roots. This is then compared to their counterparts found in the math.h file by computing the differences between them.

This program is used to run:
    -Euler's approximation of e.
    -Multiple different approximations for pi from different mathematicials/scientists.
    -Newton's method for solving square roots.

The program then compares the results to the ones found in math.h.

## Building

Build the program with:
...
$ make
...

Another way to build the program is:
...
$ make all
...

## Running

Run the program with:
...
$ ./mathlib-test
...
